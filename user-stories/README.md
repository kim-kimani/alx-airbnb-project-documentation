# 📖 User Stories Documentation – Airbnb Clone Backend

This directory contains documentation that translates the **functional requirements** of the Airbnb Clone backend into **user stories**, derived from the Use Case Diagram. These user stories help the development team understand how different types of users will interact with the system.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To convert use cases into clear, concise, and actionable **user stories** that:

- Represent real-world interactions between users and the system.
- Help guide feature development and testing.
- Ensure alignment with user needs and business goals.

## 📝 What Are User Stories?

User stories are short descriptions of functionality told from the perspective of the end-user. They follow the format:

> **As a** `<type of user>`,  
> **I want** `<an action>`  
> **So that** `<value/benefit>`.

These stories are used to define features in an agile development process and form the basis for acceptance criteria and test cases.
